/* 
    1. Qualifiers
    
        1.1 Modifications qualifiers (allows or does not allow modification of values)

            a. const

            b. volatile - Used in multithreading contexts. Volatile variables can be edited by multiple threads. This is how data is passed between threads. 

            c. mutable - Makes things mutable.

        1.2  Life duration qualifiers (How long should a value be accessible?)

            a. static

            b. register - Suggests to compiler to put a value in CPU register. Compiler can also ignore this. 

            c. extern - External libraries can contain functionalities and be included in code when needed using linking process.
