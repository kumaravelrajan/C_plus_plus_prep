# Components of STL

1. Iterators - Can be used to loop structures like vectors.
1. Functors - Used to manage state.
1. Algorithms - Provides algorithms for searching and sorting.
1. Containers - Implementation of well defined data structures.
    1. Sequence types - Vectors, lists, deques, stacks, queues
    1. Associative types implemented using binary tress - Set, multisets, maps, mutlimaps
    1. Unordered Associative types implemented using hashmaps - Sets, multisets, maps, multimaps
